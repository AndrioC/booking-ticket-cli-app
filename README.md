# booking-ticket-cli-app
This is a simple cli app created with go language. In this project we can simulate an app where the user needs to buy tickets
for an event (concert, tech event, etc). In real life we have multiple users accessing our app simultaneously, so we have to certify that
the user can get the ticket and also be able to get an e-mail with a PDF with the ticket, but we need to do this by preveting the app from crashing.
With go we can use concurrency to help us out in accomplishing this kind of thask.

To get started with this project you need to install Go: https://go.dev/

Ok, now that you have everything setup you can running the project using either of these two commands:

- go run main.go helper.go
- go run .


Pick your fight.
